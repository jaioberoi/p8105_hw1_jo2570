```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Run tidyverse package and create a data frame called hw1_df
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

hw1_df = tibble( 
  samp = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("newyork", "boston", "atlanta", "newyork", "boston", "atlanta", "newyork", "boston"))
)


#attempting to take the mean od each variable in data frame hw1_df 

#mean of the random normal sample, samp: 
mean(pull(hw1_df, samp))
#we can get a mean value for the variable samp  

#mean of the variable vec_logical
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))  
#we can get a mean value for vec_logical 
    
#mean of the variable vec_logical
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_char))  
#we cannot take the mean of vec_char - we get an error saying that the argument is not numeric or logical 

#mean of the variable vec_factor
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)) 
#we cannot take the mean of vec_factor - we get an error saying that the argument is not numeric or logical
